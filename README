NXC Edge Side Include
=====================

This extension provides two new template functions that are meant for use on
sites behind an edge proxy supporting ESI (e.g. Varnish).

See the doc/ezsi.txt file for information on how this extension differs from
the somewhat similar eZ SI extension by eZ Systems.


The most important of these template functions is the {es-include} function,
which allows you to make the edge proxy include the content of a template or
the result of a method call in that location.

See the file doc/es-include.txt for more information on this function and its
implementations.


The other function is the {es-cache} function, which allows you to set the TTL
and other caching parameters for the edge surrogate, for that response - which
means it's useful both in the templates included with {es-include}, and in
other templates (e.g. the ones doing the including), to set how long the edge
surrogate can cache that part of the page, if at all.

See the file doc/es-cache.txt for more information on this function.


To support using this extension with Varnish 3, in particular the {es-cache}
function (see its documentation for more info), we provide a VCL-based example
implementation of EAS/1.0 in the doc/example-v3.vcl file, which also includes
some other parts we need or (can) use.
However, it is not a complete configuration for using Varnish with eZ Publish;
as an example, it does not do anything about how Varnish handles cookies.
