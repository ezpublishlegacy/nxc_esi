NXC Edge Side Include
=====================

This extension provides two new template functions that are meant for use on
sites behind an edge proxy supporting ESI (e.g. Varnish).

See the doc/ezsi.txt file for information on how this extension differs from
the somewhat similar eZ SI extension by eZ Systems.


The most important of these template functions is the {es-include} function,
which allows you to make the edge proxy include the content of a template or
the result of a method call in that location.

See the file doc/es-include.txt for more information on this function and its
implementations.


The other function is the {es-cache} function, which allows you to set the TTL
and other parameters for the edge cache, for that request - which means it's
useful both in the templates included with {es-include}, and in other templates
(e.g. the ones doing the including), to set how long the edge surrogate can
cache that part of the page, if at all.

Note that the {es-cache} function is only useful when you have an edge proxy
supporting the Edge Architecture Specification 1.0, as it uses that standard
to tell the surrogate how to process the response. This specification can be
found here: http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-edge-arch-20010804


While Varnish 3 does not natively support this standard, we provide an example
implementation in VCL that works with this extension in doc/example-v3.vcl.
That example also includes code to support the simpler variant of specifying
when to do ESI processing by sending a custom X-Do-ESI header.
