NXC Edge Side Include
=====================

This extension provides a new template function {es-include}, meant for use on
sites behind an edge proxy supporting ESI (e.g. Varnish).

See the doc/ezsi.txt file for information on how this extension differs from
the somewhat similar eZ SI extension by eZ Systems.


While this is meant to be used with ESI, using different implementations of the
include mechanism is supported, so this can be used even on sites where the
needed mechanism is not based on ESI/1.0 but on something else. As an example,
you could provide an implementation for e.g. SSI and have that be used instead.

At the moment, this extension comes with three implementations:
- nxcESITypeNone simply discards the include, not giving any content.
- nxcESITypePHP does the inclusion server-side in PHP before sending any output
	to the browser; mostly useful when no other mechanism is available,
	and has some limitations.
- nxcESITypeESI is the main and default implementation, which outputs ESI/1.0
	<esi:include> tags to make the edge proxy fetch the included content
	from the server, via a module view this extension provides.


The ESI syntax is based on the W3C document ESI Language Specification 1.0,
which can be found here: http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-esi-lang-20010804

However, not all of that specification is supported; this extension
concentrates on the include functionality as per the <esi:include> tag, as that
is the most widely supported part as far as I know, and the most immediately
useful in the context of eZ Publish (and other server-side generated sites).
